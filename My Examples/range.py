#range
#this prints 0 to 4 not he actual numbers, we will use a for loop for this in the next block
# numbers = range(5)
# print(numbers)

#Range using for loop
# numbers = range(5)
# for number in numbers: #shows each number on a new line
#     print(number)

#supplying 2 numbers
# numbers = range(5, 10)
# for number in numbers: #prints 5 to 9
#     print(number)

#Showing range in intervales using 3 numbers, third number is the step
# numbers = range(5, 10, 2) #this will skip 2 numbers each time 
# for number in numbers:
#     print(number)

# showing range with a set number like 5
