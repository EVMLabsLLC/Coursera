# Chapter 4: Functions and Error Handling

This chapter covers fundamental concepts in Python programming, focusing on functions and error handling.

## Exercise 4.1: Functions and Return Values
File: `4_1.py`

This exercise demonstrates several key concepts:
- Function definition and parameters
- Return values
- String operations with `max()` and `min()`
- User input handling
- Conditional logic in functions

The file contains examples of:
1. String manipulation using `max()` and `min()` functions
2. A greeting function that returns different messages based on language input
3. A function demonstrating return value behavior (note: the `addtwo` function has a bug where it returns `a` instead of `added`)

## Exercise 4.6: Pay Calculator with Error Handling
File: `4_6.py`

This exercise implements a pay calculator with two versions:
1. Basic version without error handling
2. Enhanced version with error handling

Key concepts demonstrated:
- Function implementation for business logic
- Overtime calculations (time and a half for hours over 40)
- Type conversion (string to float)
- Error handling using try-except blocks
- User input validation

The program:
- Takes hours worked and hourly rate as input
- Calculates regular pay for hours up to 40
- Applies overtime rate (1.5x) for hours beyond 40
- Includes error handling for non-numeric input

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding function definition and usage
- Working with return values
- Implementing conditional logic
- Handling user input
- Basic error handling with try-except blocks
- Type conversion and validation
- Business logic implementation
