#While loops, if the while remains true, the loop will continue to run
# n = 5
# while n > 0:
#     print(n)
#     n = n - 1
# print("Blastoff!")

#Simpler way to write the above code using definate loop
# for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
#     print(i)
# print("Blastoff!")

#For a list of strings, we can use a for loop to iterate through the list
friends = ["Joseph", "Glenn", "Sally"]
for friend in friends: 
    print("Happy New Year:", friend)
