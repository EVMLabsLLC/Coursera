# Chapter 5: Loops and Iterations

This chapter covers various aspects of loops and iterations in Python, including while loops, for loops, and common loop patterns.

## File Contents

### 5_1.py - Basic Loop Concepts
- Introduces while loops and their basic structure
- Shows how to convert a while loop to a for loop
- Demonstrates iterating through a list of strings using a for loop
- Example: Printing "Happy New Year" messages to a list of friends

### 5_2.py - Finding Maximum and Minimum Values
- Interactive program that finds the largest and smallest numbers from user input
- Uses a while loop with a "done" sentinel value
- Implements error handling for invalid inputs
- Demonstrates the use of None as an initial value
- Shows how to maintain running maximum and minimum values

### 5_3.py - Finding the Largest Number
- Demonstrates finding the largest number in a list
- Shows the process of updating a running maximum
- Includes debugging print statements to track the search process
- Uses a for loop to iterate through a predefined list of numbers

### 5_4.py - Common Loop Patterns
Contains several important loop patterns and idioms:
1. Counting in a loop
2. Adding numbers in a loop
3. Calculating averages in a loop
4. Finding the smallest value using None
5. A worked exercise that:
   - Takes user input until "done"
   - Handles invalid inputs
   - Calculates the sum and average of valid numbers

## Key Concepts
- While loops vs For loops
- Loop control (break, continue)
- Error handling with try/except
- Common loop patterns (counting, summing, averaging)
- Finding maximum and minimum values
- Using None as a special value
- Input validation and processing
- Sentinel values for loop termination

## Best Practices
- Always initialize variables before loops
- Use appropriate error handling for user input
- Consider using None for finding max/min values
- Include proper loop termination conditions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
